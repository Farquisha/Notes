Explain IP Addressing


Describe Classful IPv4 addressing and subnetting:
    Class A (0 to 127)
    Class B (128 to 191)
    Class C (192 to 223)
    Class D (224 to 239) - Multicasting
    Class E (240 to 255) - Not used

Subnetting:
    IP addresses:
        Network Portion
        Host Portion
    Practice of "borrowing" host bits and used them as subnet bits.

Identify IPv4 address types:
    Unicast - Any Class A thu C
    Multicast - Class D
    Broadcast - Any IP were the host portion is all on


IPv4 Fragmentation:
    Breaking up packets from higher MTU to lower MTU network
    Performed by routers
    MF flag is on from 1st until 2nd to last
    Offset is on from 2nd until the last
    Offset = (MTU - (IHL x 4)) ÷ 8

IPv6 Fragmentation:
    IPv6 does not support fragmentation within it’s header
    Routers do not fragment IPv6 packets
    Source adjusts MTU to avoid fragmentation
    Source can use IPv6 fragmentation extension header

Fragmentation Vulnerability:
    Can use fragmentation overlaps to avoid firewall detection
    Attack depends on how OS deals with overlap
    Example: Teardrop attack

IPv4 Auto Configuration:
    APIPA
        169.254.0.0/16
        RFC 3927
    DHCP
        DORA process
        RFC 1531

IPv4 Auto Configuration Vulnerability:
    Rogue DHCP
    Evil Twin
    DHCP Starvation

=======================================================================================

ICMPv4 OS Fingerprinting
    Linux:
        Default size: 64 bytes
        Payload message:
        !\”#\$%&\‘()*+,-./01234567

    Windows:
        Default size: 40 bytes
        Payload message:
        abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwabcdefghi

ICMPv4 Traceroute:
    Identifies hops between the source and destination
    Uses incrementing TTLs
    Hops return an ICMP Type 11 Time exceeded message when TTL reaches zero
    Continues until it reaches target or 30 hops*

ICMPv4 Traceroute (Linux)
  Default:
      traceroute 172.16.82.106
      traceroute -U 172.16.82.106
  Requires root:
      sudo traceroute -I 172.16.82.106
      sudo traceroute -T 172.16.82.106
      sudo traceroute -T 172.16.82.106 -p 443

ICMPv4 Attacks
    Firewalking (traceroute)
    Oversized ICMP messages
    ICMP Redirects
    SMURF Attack (Remember SMURF and FRAGGLE from JCAC)
    Map network w/ IP unreachables
    ICMP Covert Channels

Describe IPv6 addressing


IPv6 Addressing:
    128 bit address
    64-bit Prefix (4 hextets)
    64-bit Interface ID (4 hextets)
    340 undecillian addresses

IPv6 address representation:
    128-bit (64bit Prefix and 64bit Int ID)
    Represented using 32 Hex digits
    Hextet: 4 hex separated by (:)
IPv6 addr. shortening
    Can shorten consecutive 0’s with (::)
    Can only use it once
    e.g.  2001:0:0:1::1

Identify IPv6 address types:
    Unicast
    Multicast
    Anycast

IPv6 address scopes:
    Global Unicast Addresses (2000::/3)
    Unique Local (fc00::/7)
    Loopback (::1/128)
    Link-Local (fe80::/10)
    Multicast (ff00::/8)

IPv6 zero configuration (Link-Local):
    Hosts generate link-local prefix (FE80::/8)
    Interface ID can be:
        Random (Windows default)
        EUI-64 (nix* and Cisco default)

IPv6 zero configuration (Global):
    Hosts requests global prefix
        SLAAC (RFC 4862) (default)
        DHCPv6 (configured)

    Interface ID can be:
        EUI-64 (nix* and Cisco default)
        Random (Windows default)

IPv6 zero configuration Vulnerability:
    SLAAC MitM
    Can be used to figerprint OS
    Rogue DHCP
    Evil Twin
    DHCP Starvation

=======================================================================================

Neighbor Discovery Protocol (NDP):
    Router Solicitation (Type 133)
    Router Advertisement (Type 134)
    Neighbor Solicitation (Type 135)
    Neighbor Advertisement (Type 136)
    Redirect (Type 137)

Metrics:
    RIP: Hop
    EIGRP: Bandwidth, Delay, Load, Reliability
    OSPF: Cost
    BGP: Policy

Routing Protocol vulnerabilities:
    Distributed Denial of Service (DDOS)
    Packet Mistreating Attacks (PMA)
    Routing Table Poisoning (RTP)
    Hit and Run DDOS (HAR)
    Persistent Attacks (PA)

BGP:
    Road-map of the Internet
    Routes traffic between Autonomous System (AS) Number
    Advertises IP CIDR address blocks
    Establishes Peer relationships
    Complicated configuration
    Complicated and slow path selection

BGP Operation

    How BGP chooses the best path:
        Advertise a more specific route. 192.168.1.0 /24 is more specific than 192.168.0.0 /16.
        Offer a shorter route to certain blocks of IP addresses.
        A route to ip prefix with 4 AS 'hops" is better than route with 5 AS 'hops'

BGP Hijacking:
    Illegitimate advertising of addresses
    BGP propagates false information
    Purpose:
        stealing prefixes
        monitoring traffic
        intercept (and possibly modify) Internet traffic
        'black holing' traffic
        perform MitM

BGP Hijacking Defense:
    IP prefix filtering
    BGP hijacking detection
        Tracking the change in TTL of incoming packets
        Increased Round Trip Time (RTT) which increases latency
        Monitoring misdirected traffic (change in AS path from tools like Looking Glass)
