Sensors: 
    In-Line:
        Placed between communicating devices to stop attacks
            Intrusion Prevention System (IPS)
            Firewall
Impacts network latency
ex.: vvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvv
        Test Access Point (TAP):
    - Appliance placed between 2 network devices
    - Best for packet collection with no data loss
    - Must be placed "in line" of network traffic
    - Not Scalable
    - Will need several installed to capture traffic for other network segments

        Man-in-the-Middle (MitM):
    - Attacker can use ARP or some other method/protocol
    - Attackers can sniff or manipulate traffic that flows through them
    - Typically must be on the same network as the victim
    - Traffic capture is dependent on the attacker’s system and bandwidth
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Out of Band (Passive):
        Monitors network segments
        Can detect attacks but cannot stop them
        Gets copies of network traffic
            Intrusion Detection System (IDS)
    Does not impact network latency
ex.:
        Switched Port Analyzer (SPAN):
    - Configured on the network Switch
    - Best for packet collection of traffic from several switch ports at once
    - Scalable
    - Can have a high degree of packet loss
    - Places burden on the network Switch

default characteristics for system identification::

Fingerprinting and Host Identification:
Tools used for fingerprinting and host identification can be used passively(sniffing/fingerprinting) or actively(scanning)

Fingerprinting:
    Active OS fingerprinting (Sends Packets);
        - Easier
        - Send packets to the target and monitor response
        Tools:
            - Nmap
            - Xprobe2
            - sinfp3
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    Passive OS fingerprinting (No Packets);
        - More difficult
        - Rely on sniffing packets
        Tools:
            - p0f
            - Ettercap
            - PRADS

Anomaly Detection:
    Indicator of Attack (IOA):
        Proactive;
        - A series of actions that are suspicious together
        - Focus on Intent
        - Looks for what must happen
            ~ Code execution. persistence, lateral movement, etc.
    Indicator of Compromise (IOC):
        - Reactive
        - Forensic Evidence
        - Provides Information that can change
            ~ Malware, IP addresses, exploits, signatures
Some Indicators:
    - .exe/executable files
    - NOP sled
    - Repeated Letters
    - Well Known Signatures
    - Mismatched Protocols
    - Unusual traffic

ICMP Tunneling:
    ICMP PING uses Type 8 and Type 0. Both should be:
        1 for 1
        Same size and payload
    Look out for:
        Request/Reply imbalances
        Abnormal/different payloads
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
DNS Tunneling:
    DNS uses Query/Response
        1 Query typically gets 1 response
    Look out for:
        Query/Response imbalances
        Abnormal/different payloads
        Continuous Queries
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
HTTP(S) Tunneling:
    HTTP is "bursty" in nature
    Client issues request and the server responds
    Look out for:
        Steady connections
        HTTPs you will need to check session establishment for abnormalities
===============================================================================================================================
Beaconing::

    Call back to the C&C server
    Gets/sends commands from/to C&C
    Look out for:
        - Beacon Timing
            Commonly at regular intervals
        - Beacon Size
            Check-Ins may not have any payloads
            Orders will have payloads
