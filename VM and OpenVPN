#OpenVPN
Purpose of Guide - to provide a clear repeatable steps for setting up OpenVPN for home use.

What is OpenVPN? - it is open-source software that implements a virtual private network (VPN) to create secure connections between remote hosts or even entire networks. OpenVPN establishes SSL/TLS tunnels which allow hosts to access resources as if they were on the same LAN despite being across the internet.

Why use it? - OpenVPN provides students the ability to complete CTF challenges after class and instructors the ability to work from home by allowing personal devices to securely connect to the internal schoolhouse network.
	While the US Cyber School/VTA network is affiliated with the U.S. Army this network is not to be confused with NIPR or the Army "domain" in general; this will not help you access the same Army admin websites you have trouble accessing from home.
